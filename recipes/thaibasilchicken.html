            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or as needed</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced Thai chilies</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until well
            blended.</li>
            <li>Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3
            minutes. Stir in garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to
            caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until
            sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Stir in holy basil. Cook and stir until holy basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.</li>
        </ol>
